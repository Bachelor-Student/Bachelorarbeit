In here, every output generated with the created programms is listed in order.

While "Anglizismenparser" and "Woerterbuchparser" only contains output of one single run, the "Anglizismendetector" is more versatile
and thus, can be run with more than just one input. Because this repository doesn't contain one single file of the Songkorpus, and so the user can't replicate it themselfes, the output for all used methods is given directly in this way. 

Most of the content is output only, as it is in all test for the used methods, aswell as in the complete run with all songtexts with the best detected method.
However there was also a test if theres an noticable difference between automatic and manuell lemmatisation and in this directionary even some resources are given. In there one can find the data of all manually found anglizisms in the sample sized korpus.
