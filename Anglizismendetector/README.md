# DeepPant-Anglizismendetector
This Programm is meant to scan in a whole korpus of Songtexts and detect full anglizisms and anglizism-chains within the korpus. Finally it sorts the output by categories.

There is no implemented function, which only uses one anglizismlist. But if the user wants to only use one of the three lists, then this can be easily done by just deleting the whole content "" of the other lists.
The Korpus and the anglizismlists are scaleable and cant get too big, however its depending of the users storage of course.
